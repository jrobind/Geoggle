# Geoggle

Geoggle is a countries of the world quiz game. The quiz features questions on country capitals, flags, populations, and world regions and subregions. Country data is sourced using the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu/#rest-countries), whilst flag images are sourced from [flagpedia](http://flagpedia.net/).

Geoggle is built using plain old Vanilla ES6 - no frameworks or libraries here. To play the quiz, follow the link (be warned - it's addictive): https://jrobind.github.io/Geoggle/

## Features

The quiz can be played in either __easy__ or __hard__ mode. Easy mode has no question timer and features questions regarding country flags, regions, and capitals. Hard mode includes a question timer and features all of the question types covered in easy mode plus population and subregion based questions.
